I have played piano since I was five and continue to perform in college; I currently study with Betty Woo. I used to compete a lot in high school, where I won competitions such as the East Bay Music Festival and US Open Piano Competition. After three years away from competitions, I obtained an honorable mention in the 2017 CA state concerto competition and was a winner of the UC Berkeley concerto competition - I had the honor of performing Rachmaninoff's 2nd piano concerto with the UC Berkeley Symphony Orchestra in spring 2017. I also play jazz and am active in the UC Jazz ensembles.

Here are some recordings of me:
