Welcome to my website (many parts currently under construction)! I am a fourth year undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying computer science and statistics. My current research interests include machine learning (particularly on the statistical/theoretical side) and applied probability. Aside from these, I am a bit of a math nerd and enjoy studying more abstract fields such as topology. In spite of my theoretical interests, my current research with Aviv Tamar and Pieter Abbeel is more practical and is somewhat related to the issue of adversarial examples in machine learning such as described [here](https://blog.openai.com/adversarial-example-research/). A preprint of the paper we are working on is available [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1711.08534).

I am also passionate about teaching - for two semesters, I was a teaching assistant for CS 70 (Discrete Math and Probability Theory), and this semester will be my first time TA'ing for CS 189 (Machine Learning). 

Aside from academics, I enjoy playing piano - you can hear some recordings in the tab [above](https://williamwwang.github.io/music/). I also occasionally play table tennis and regularly bake sweets (think cookies, cupcakes, etc.) If you are in my sections I try to bring goodies after exams.
