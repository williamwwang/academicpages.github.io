Welcome to my website (many parts currently under construction)! I am a fourth year undergraduate at UC Berkeley studying computer science and statistics. My current research interests include machine learning (think more on the statistical/theoretical side) and applied probability. Aside from these, I am a bit of a math nerd and enjoy studying more abstract fields such as topology. In spite of my theoretical interests, my current research with Aviv Tamar and Pieter Abbeel is more practical and concerns the issue of adversarial examples in machine learning such as described [here](https://blog.openai.com/adversarial-example-research/).

I am also passionate about teaching - Fall 2017 will be my second time as a teaching assistant for CS 70 (Discrete Math and Probability Theory). For better or for worse, I am known for putting hard problems on exams - we can't just make all the questions freebies :) I also have a habit of helping out in CS61A every so often via lab assisting or CS Mentors, as it makes me nostalgic for my carefree college freshman days when recursion seemed like sorcery and thinking of functions as objects blew my mind.

Aside from academics, I enjoy playing piano - you can read more in the tab [above](https://williamwwang.github.io/music/). I also occasionally play table tennis and regularly bake sweets (think cookies, cupcakes, etc.) If you are in my sections I will probably have goodies after exams.
